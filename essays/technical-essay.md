## My First Meeting with TypeScript

In the diverse landscape of programming languages, Typescript stands out as a statically-typed superset of JavaScript that introduces additional features and syntactic enhancements. For someone like me, who has only worked with Java and Python, transitioning to TypeScript has been both a challenge and exciting experience 

Typescript incorporates many object-oriented programming (OOP) features that I’m familiar with from Java, such as classes, interfaces, and inheritance. These features help structuring large codebases and maintaining clear, modular, and reusable code. This familiarity has made my transition to TypeScript a little bit easier, although I will need some time to get used to the syntax. 

The OOP aspect of TypeScript brings me to why I think TypeScript is a very suitable programming language from a software engineering perspective. The features of OOP contributes to a more maintainable, reusable and robust code, which will be important aspects of software engineering. 

Another new experience for me has been the athletics software engineering, introducing me to WODs where I’m pressured on time and have to really focus on my code in that specific moment. This has been a significant shift for me, as I typically prefer to take my time when coding. However, that is exactly why I think this challenge is so good for me, because it presses me to get out of my comfort zone and helps me develop my coding skills more rapidly. While the WODs can be somewhat stressful, I anticipate that I will come to appreciate them and even find them enjoyable as I continue to improve.
