From the moment I began creating HTML code to design my personal pink blogs as a young girl, I've been intrigued by the world of information technology. As I pursued a degree in IT and Economics at university, I quickly noticed that this is a male-dominated field, which only strengthened my resolve to contribute as a woman in tech. 



After a visit at Googleplex with my class in January 2024, my eyes really opened up for software engineering. Meeting a fellow Norwegian who had successfully transitioned from a small country to one of the world's largest tech companies inspired me deeply. Since then, I have seriously considered a future career as a software engineer or developer. 



I hope to keep on developing my skills, and in the future I aspire to contribute to tech companies in Norway by applying my software engineering skills to drive innovation and digital transformation. I also hope to inspire and support more woman in tech, fostering a more inclusive environment where diverse perspectives can thrive and shape the future of the industry in Norway. I would love to see Norway strengthen its position in the global technology landscape, especially in the comparison to other Scandinavian countries like Sweden and Denmark, which have already established strong reputations for innovation.
