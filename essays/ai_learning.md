#### I. Introduction
 
Looking back at my journey in programming, it’s kind of wild to think about how much has changed with AI entering the picture. I remember the days when Stack Overflow was my best friend, and I’d spend hours searching through posts and reaching out to older students for help. Now, with tools like ChatGPT and Github Copilot at our fingertips, the whole learning experience has totally shifted. To be honest, I probably use AI more than I initially thought I would, and sometimes that makes me pause and think. But hey, those tools are here now, right? So why not use them to our advantage - as long as we’re thoughtful about it and actually reflect on how we’re using them, which is exactly what I’m doing now.

#### II. Personal Experience with AI
Let me break down how I’ve been using AI throughout my Software Engineering, ICS314, course:

**Experience WODs**  
For our Experience WODs, I actually saw these as a great opportunity to tackle these challenges without relying on AI. The Experience WODs were my safe space where I could really learn and understand things properly. Even though they were supposed to be timed, I gave myself permission to slow down and work through problems the old-school way - you know, actually figuring stuff out step by step without rushing to AI for answers. Sure, I often had to watch the screencasts to help me get started, but that felt more authentic to my learning style. I’d work through the WOD first at my own pace, then try to speed it up on subsequent attempts. Looking back, these were probably the assignments where I used AI tools the least, and I’m kind of glad about that. It gave me a chance to build that fundamental understanding that you just can’t get from quick AI solutions. 

**In-class Practise WODs**  
For practice WODs, I tried to keep it real and limit my AI use. These were my chances to actually test what I knew without a safety net. But even though these WODs were only for practice and not graded, I could often feel myself getting stressed If I got stuck or used too much time. Then I would peek at what ChatGPT had to say, and he usually had a lot of useful things to say. 

**In-Class WODs**  
Let’s be real - during in-class WODs, time pressure is no joke. And you probably already guessed it - if I got stressed during my practice WODs, I most definitely got stressed during my graded in-class WODs. ChatGPT became my trusty sidekick here. When I get stressed I find it hard to concentrate, and sometimes I just needed ChatGPT to help see why I was getting errors or why my code was not doing what the task description asked for. Though I made sure I understood what it was suggesting before blindly accepting anything. 

**Essays**   
For essays, AI became like a brainstorming partner. Instead of staring at a blank screen, i’d bounce ideas off ChatGPT. Still, all the actual content came from my own experiences and thoughts - the AI just helped me get the ball rolling and structure my thoughts. 

**Final Project**  
The final project was where I really leaned into using GitHub Copilot, which I had not been using before. It saved me so much time on the basic stuff, like setting up components and writing boilerplate code. This freed me up to focus on the more interesting parts of the project, like figuring out the overall architecture and implementing the cool features. 

**Learning a concept / tutorial**  
AI is great for learning new concepts, and this is probably one of the smartest ways I used AI throughout the course. WHat I loved about ChatGPT was how it could break down complex ideas into simple terms, and if I still didn’t get it, I could just say “Hey, can you explain that even simpler?” or “Can you give me an example?” And boom - it would try again with an even clearer explanation and some code examples to boot. When using AI you don’t have to be scared to seem stupid, you can ask as many times as you need until you really get it!

**Answering a question in class or in Discord**  
This one’s pretty straightforward - if I knew the answer, I answered. No need to complicate things by bringing AI into it. When I felt confident enough to help out a classmate, it meant I actually understood the concept well enough to explain it myself. That’s the kind of knowledge you want to share directly. 

**Asking or answering a smart-question**  
The smart-question channel turned out to be super valuable for me! I remember this one time where I was totally stuck. I spent hours trying to figure out why one of my essays wouldn’t get posted on this github.io site. ChatGPT could not save me on this one, so instead I used chatGPT to better understand my issue so I could ask a clearer question. And I’m glad I did! Turned out another student had run into the exact same problem, and all it took was changing one line of code to get everything working again.  

**Coding example / Explaining code / Writing code**  
These three really go hand in hand in my experience. While I used AI differently for each, they all kind of blended together in my learning process. For coding examples, I’d ask for them to better understand a concept. When it came to explaining code, I would try understanding it myself first, and then use AI to fill in the gaps if needed. As for writing code, I tried to find a balance. I’d use AI for inspiration or when I was really stuck, but I made sure to write a lot of code myself too. 

**Documenting code**  
Documentation is another area where AI can be super helpful, though I realize I probably didn’t use it as much as I could have. Looking back, I see some missed opportunities - it could have helped me write better commit messages during our final project, or just helped me document my thought process when I was deep in the coding zone and everything made sense (but might not have made sense later!). 

**Quality assurance**  
This is where AI really got to shine for me in ICS314. Whether it was tracking down bugs, fixing ESLint errors, or just making sure my code was following the best practices, AI tools were incredibly useful. They saved me tons of time on the nitty-gritty details and helped me catch issues I might have missed otherwise. Looking back at the time before AI I remember one time I almost spent a whole day trying to figure out why my code wouldn’t run in my OOP Java project - it turned out I was missing a curly bracket. Today that would have taken me less than a second to fix with AI.   

**Other uses**  
The categories we’ve covered pretty much sum up my AI usage in this course. While I’m sure there are other creative ways to use AI in software engineering, these were the main ways I found it helpful in ICS314.

#### III. Impact on Learning and Understanding
I’ve got mixed feelings about how AI has affected my learning. On one hand, it’s incredible how quickly I can find solutions and understand new concepts now. But sometimes I catch myself feeling I’m taking the easy way out. It’s different from the old days when I had to really dig through Stack Overflow and figure things out the hard way. Those struggles definitely taught me a lot, but then again, maybe using AI smartly is just as valuable a skill for modern development. 

#### IV. Practical Applications
Outside of ICS 314, one interesting real-world application of AI I’ve come across is Highcharts GPT, an AI-powered tool developed by Highsoft. Highcharts is already a widely used JavaScript library for creating interactive data visualizations, but Highcharts GPT takes it to the next level by using natural language processing to make chart creation even easier. Instead of manually writing code to configure charts, users can simply describe what they need, such as “Create a bar chart comparing monthly sales in 2023 and 2024.” The AI interprets the input, selects the right chart type, and generates the necessary configuration. This tool addresses a real-world software engineering challenge by reducing the time and expertise needed to create professional-grade visualizations. It’s a perfect example of how AI can make advanced tools more accessible, empowering developers and non-technical users alike while streamlining workflows.

#### V. Challenges and Opportunities
The biggest challenge I’ve faced is maintaining a balance. When should I push through and solve something on my own, and when does it make sense to ask AI for help? It’s like having a super-smart friend who’s always ready to help - great to have around, but you don’t want to rely on them for everything. 

#### VI. Comparative Analysis
Before AI tools, learning felt more challenging but also more thorough. Each solution required deep research and understanding. WIth AI, learning can be faster, but it’s easier to skip the valuable struggle that leads to deeper understanding.

#### VII.Future Considerations
As these AI tools keep getting better (which they definitely will), we'll probably need to rethink how we teach and learn programming. Instead of debating whether to use AI or not, we should focus on teaching smart ways to use it. It's becoming as essential as learning to use Google or Stack Overflow was back in the day.

#### VIII. Conclusion
Looking back at this semester, I can see that AI tools have definitely changed how I learn and work. Sure, I might use them more than I initially thought I would, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The key has been staying aware of how I'm using them and making sure they're helping me learn, not just giving me quick fixes. As we move forward, finding that balance between traditional learning and AI assistance will be super important. After all, these tools aren't going anywhere - we might as well learn to use them wisely!
