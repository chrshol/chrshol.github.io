## More than just rules - Coding as a Language

In the world of software engineering, coding standards are often seen as a set of rigid rules, much like grammar in a spoken language. Just as grammar enables clear communication, coding standards provide a shared “grammar” for software engineers, allowing them to express their ideas in a way that is understandable to others. However, these standards do more than just facilitate communication - they influence how we approach problems, fostering both creativity and discipline. Even though it may feel like coding standards are constraining us, it really enables us to write code that is not only functional but also elegant and maintainable. 


## Painful, but Useful

Standards like ESLint serve purpose beyond only catching errors - they guide us toward cleaner, more efficient coding patterns. Initially, using ESLint can feel frustrating, especially when it will underline the entire code snippet in red for something as minor as a missing space. I've experienced this firsthand, and it can be irritating, especially when I feel like I've done everything right.

However, I also recognize that ESLint is immensely useful. These "annoying little rules" act as training wheels, helping to shape our subconscious habits over time. Linters serve as a constant reminder of the importance of clean code and helps catch errors that I might overlook. Each time I fix an error, I learn more about coding standards and best practices. So, while the process can be painful and ESLint seems unforgiving at first, it is undeniably beneficial in the long run.


## Being a Teamplayer

Coding standards are not just about pleasing a machine - they are essential for effective teamwork. When multiple developers adhere to the same standards, it creates a sense of uniformity that makes collaboration much smoother. Imagine trying to work on a project where every developer has their own unique style - chaos would surely ensue!



## Trust the process

While coding standards may seem like a tedious aspect of software engineering, they are vital for creating high-quality, maintainable code. My experience with ESLint has shown me that, despite the frustration it can cause, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. By embracing coding standards, developers can enhance their skills, improve collaboration, and ultimately deliver better software. So, the next time I find myself grappling with a red error line, I will remember that it's all part of the journey toward becoming a better coder.
